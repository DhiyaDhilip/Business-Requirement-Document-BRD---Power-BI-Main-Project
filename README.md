# Business-Requirement-Document-BRD---Power-BI-Main-Project
Power BI dashboard analyzing global economic and demographic trends across countries and regions. Visuals include GDP per capita, population, literacy, migration, mortality, and density. Enables comparative insights by income group and region for data-driven decision-making.


##   Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis

###  Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides a multi-dimensional analysis of global economic and demographic indicators across countries, regions, and income groups. It enables stakeholders to explore patterns in GDP, population, literacy, migration, mortality, and birth rates — all through interactive visualizations tailored for strategic decision-making.
